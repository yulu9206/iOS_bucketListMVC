Satori Worldwide, Inc. ("Satori") hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated below)
patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, transfer, and otherwise run, modify, and propagate the contents
of the Satori SDKs and related code (the "Software") as necessary for your use of Satori services,
where such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned
by Satori and acquired in the future, licensable by Satori that are necessarily
infringed by these implementations of the Software.

This grant does not include claims that would be infringed only as
a consequence of further modification of the Software or use of the Software
in combination with any other software or technology.  If you or your agent
or exclusive licensee institute or order or encourage or agree to the
institution of patent litigation or any other patent enforcement activity
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that any of these implementations of the Software or any code
incorporated within any of these implementations of the Software constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent
infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this license
for these implementations of the Software shall automatically terminate
as of the date such action is filed.
